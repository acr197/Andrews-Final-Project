				<strong>Andrew Ryan</strong> is a digital marketing analyst based in New York City. He currently works at DigitasLBi as a Media Tech Analyst for Under Armour and Delta Airlines, and formerly for Pitney Bowes, FIS, NYSE, and Izze Drinks. <br> <br>
				Over the past decade, Andrew has taken on a variety of professional roles. From the sales floor, to compliance management, and even international bank accounts, he has seen success in all of his previous jobs. Eventually, he fell into his best suited role to date at his current agency, which requires sharp technical skill, a fast pace, and an equal balance of challenges, communication, and constant learning.<br> <br>
				In an effort to show his dedication and strive in his field, Andrew has completed the Google Adwords and Google Analytics Certification, completed a course on Front End Web Development, and plans to continue taking courses and certifications in Excel and analytics this year. This website was also completely designed and coded by him from scratch.<br> <br>
				When he's not working, you will probably find Andrew writing and recording music in his home-studio, traveling to a new part of the world, cooking an excesive amount of food for his next dinner, or trying something new on the menu over the weekend. <br> <br>
