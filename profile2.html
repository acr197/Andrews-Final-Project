			<p class="pers-body-text">When I'm not in front of a computer screen, you might find me exploring the city, cooking an overabundance of food, or trying something I've never had before on a menu. <br> <br>
			I spend most of time time trying to be productive and keep up with my hobbies, and though this does require quite a bit of time in fornt of a screen, I try not to spend that time watching TV, movies, or playing games as opposed to creating music, tinkering with my home-built computer, or building websites (like this one!) <br> <br> <br> <br>

			<div class="pers-title-text">Fun Facts</div>

					<li>I'm distantly related to WWE wrestlers The Bellas Twins</li>

	<div class="pers-title-text">Travel</div>
		<ul>
			<li class="pers-body-text">I've been to 20+ countries, 30+ US cities, and counting. For better or worse, I now have a reputation that my friends and family want to tap into that consist of finding flights for (nearly) free by accumulating miles + points...but not from flying.</li>
		</ul>
	<div class="pers-title-text"><br>Music</div>
		<ul>
			<li class="pers-body-text">I've been in and out of bands since I got my first drumset at 10 years old. I've played in alternative, classic rock, ska, and hard rock bands, and most recently an acoustic duo which donated our EP profits to a Philadelphia charity for sick children. In recent years, I've been writing, recording, producing, and mixing my own songs on my home-built computer for my bedroom studio. </li>
		</ul>
	<div class="pers-title-text"><br>Food</div>
		<ul>
			<li class="pers-body-text">I don't consider myself a chef of any caliber, but you'll probably always see me with self-cooked leftover for lunch - especially when I make a multi-gallon batch of my family's tamato sauce reecipe and meatballs from scratch. </li>
