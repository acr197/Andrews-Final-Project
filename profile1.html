			This position demands someone who has exceptional familiarity with operations and reporting procedures, strong communication skills, and has a fast learning curve. Based off of my success and willingness to learn I have shared with you, I hope that you fully believe that I am that candidate. I would be exceedingly grateful to have an opportunity to contribute to a corporation that gives back to those to service our country and volunteers – as I am also beginning a volunteer project of my own for a local charity benefitting the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania. Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my qualifications and how I will contribute to CNCS, and I look forward to speaking with you.

		<div class="profile-1-upper-right">My current role as a Due Diligence Risk Analyst has given me extensive familiarity in advanced research analysis, in-depth record evaluation, and working with large amounts of data from our own archive – the largest in the world of its kind – as well as various other third party sources to create reports for. This daily requirement of completing complex assignments and balancing many time-critical responsibilities in a fast paced environment are invaluable for any operations assistant, and skills I would look forward to applying at the CNCS on top of the methods your ops team incorporates. Above this, I also have experience communicating with third parties when necessary to address their queries and concerns, and sharing these occurrences with management. As a result of undertaking this always-increasing workload so efficiently and keeping attention to detail so high, my team’s success was proven when our company achieved a rank on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500 list for the last two consecutive years – all while the size of the team I am on remained largely unchanged.
