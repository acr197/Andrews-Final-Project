			<div class="pers-title-text"><br>About</div>
			<p class="pers-body-text">Hi. I'm Andrew. I built this site to show off my professional abilities, work history, and how valuable I would be working for you. <br><br>
				But I'm productive out of the workplace too. Let me explain...<br><br>
				When I'm not in front of a computer screen, you might find me exploring the city, cooking an overabundance of food, or planning my next trip to a city I probably can't even pronounce.<br><br>
				But I didn't end up where I am by chance.<br><br>
				<i>&lt;Begin flashback story&gt;</i> <br><br>
				I graduated from Penn State in 2011 and got real-life rolling right away. My first week out, I started working part time selling electronics, began freelancing as an audio engineer for local musicians and filmakers, and it wasn't before long I started traveling - knocking out three continents within two years.<br><br>
				Soon after, I dove all-in and started living the <u>dream</u><br><br> 
				I moved to Tennesse and began working in a recording studio full time. It was an exciting time to be me, and not much down-time, but it simply wasn't enough to pay the bills. So I strolled back to the Northeast like I never left. <br><br>
				Yea...people noticed I'd been gone a while.<br><br>
				So over the next several years I found a healthy balance of music creation, time with friends and family, and a comfortable job...but still couldn't sit still. I would hear stories of the  companies people worked for and enjoyed being a part of; and after jealously subsided, I knew I had it in me to give it another go. I wanted to escape the cold, dry office culture of regulatory compliance for big banks. I was destined to be in something that could combine <b>tech-forward</b> work, a <i>fast</i> pace, and maybe even the <small>occasional</small> happy hour.<br><br> 
				So I got out of banking, booked a one way trip overseas, and studied everything I needed to know about agency life on plane to plane until I got an interview. Just like that, I was on the next flight from China back to the East Coast. <br><br>
				Moving out of the music-loving, Eagles-chanting, cheesesteak-worshipping city of Philadelphia to live in New York City wasn't my first choice, but someone wiser than me once told me "If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere", and I feel like I've made it a long way. <br><br>

				<div class="pers-title-text">Travel</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="pers-body-text">I've been to over 20 countries, 30 US cities, and plan to always have more booked. How? Well...for better or worse, I have the reputation as the "travel hacker" among my friends and family, who know me best for accumulating hundreds of thousands of miles and points a year, and keeping international trip costs to totals rarely exceeding double digits. This expertise unfortunately also comes with becoming the unofficial travel agent for everybody you know.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="pers-title-text"><br>Music</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="pers-body-text">I've been in and out of bands since as long as I can remember. Though I'd considered myself primarily a drummer since my first set at the age of ten, I most recently performed original music in an <a href="https://marqueelights.bandcamp.com/releases">acoustic duo</a> that raised money for a local charity supporting the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania (CHOP). You can even check out my newest original solo music on a seperate website I <a href="http://www.jamesjunip.com">created</a>, featuring me performing, writing, and recording (approximately) everything. </li>
				</ul>
				<div class="pers-title-text"><br>Food</div>
				<ul>
					<li class="pers-body-text">While I wouldn't consider myself a chef of any caliber, you'll always find at least some attempt a self-cooked meal in my fridge, usually in quantities large enough to feed more people than I even know. If you wait for me to pick up my italian grocery order for my family's meatball and sauce recipe, you're in for a treat. Cooked by the gallons, of course. </li>
